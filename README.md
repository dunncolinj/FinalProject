# Lost Pet API Project

Team: The Foodie Trio
Contributors: Leslie Counterman, Colin Dunn, Anna Heselbarth
Version: 1.0
Release date: December 23, 2021

# Description

The Lost Pet API is a back-end interface for a pet microchip registry.
Pets may be implanted with a microchip with a unique serial number to identify them.
This API allows pet owners and pet service professionals to keep track of animals
by retaining information about a pet, their owner, and microchip numbers.
In addition, API services are provided to allow pet owners to report their pet
is lost, and to generate alerts when a pet is found and their microchip is scanned.
